# WardrobeOptimizer
## Still in EARLY Beta

This is a program written in Python with the Flask Framework and SQL Alchemy. This web application allows you upload your wardrobe and tell it what your wear everyday. You can then tell it to give you a random set of clothes that you have never worn before.

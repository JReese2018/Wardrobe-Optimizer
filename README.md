# WardrobeOptimizer
## Still in Beta

This is a program written in Python with the Flask Framework and SQL Alchemy. This web application allows you upload your wardrobe and tell it what your wear everyday. You can then tell it to give you a random set of clothes that you have never worn before.

Since this is a web application, it features HTML, CSS, and Python files. I used MySQL to manage the database, creating all of the models in [python](https://github.com/JReese2018/Wardrobe-Optimizer/blob/main/WardrobeApp/website/models.py), and the database interaction on each page can be found in the [views](https://github.com/JReese2018/Wardrobe-Optimizer/blob/main/WardrobeApp/website/views.py) file.

The HTML features bootstrap styling to create the navbar, cards, buttons, and otheres.
